# Roadmap for Git Integration

Many notebook users utilize git and GitHub to manage versions of
their notebooks and share them with others. Sometimes this process
can be quite difficult as creating diffs of the notebook format
comes with a lot of challenges. We are hoping to address this
issue and create tightly-coupled git integration in the nteract
desktop application.
